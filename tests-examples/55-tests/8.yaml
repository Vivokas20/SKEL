  5.1.8 optimal solution

  df1 <- input1 %>% filter(level != 'JR')
  df2 <- df1 %>% group_by(level) %>% summarise(meanage = mean(age)) %>% ungroup()
  out <- df2 %>% select(level,meanage) %>% distinct()

  T1 = filter(8-1, level != 'JR')
  T2 = summarise(T1, meanage = mean(age), level)
  out = select(T2, level,meanage)
