  5.2.7 optimal solution

  df1=inner_join(catalog,suppliers) %>% inner_join(parts) %>%
    filter(color == "red")
  df2=inner_join(catalog,suppliers) %>% inner_join(parts) %>%
    filter(color != "red")
  anti_join(df1,df2)

  ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION?

  df1 <- input2 %>% filter(color == 'red')
  df2 <- inner_join(inner_join(inner_join(input1, df1), input2), input3)
  out <- df2 %>% select(S_key, P_id, S_name, color) %>% distinct()
