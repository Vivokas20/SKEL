  5.3.1 optimal solution sql

  SELECT DISTINCT A.aname FROM aircraft A
  WHERE A.Aid IN (
  SELECT C.aid
  FROM certified C, employees E
  WHERE C.eid  = E.eid AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT * FROM employees E1 WHERE E1.eid = E.eid AND E1.salary  < 80000))

  ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION?

  df1 <- inner_join(inner_join(input3, input1), input2)
  df2 <- df1 %>% filter(salary >= 80000)
  out <- df2 %>% select(aname) %>% distinct()

  T1 = natural_join(aircraft, employees, certified)
  T2 = filter(T1, salary >= 80000)
  out = select(T2, aname)
