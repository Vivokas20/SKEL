Hello I'm Tony Stark.
Today I have went shopping at Laffayette.
My company is hiring interns.
"Oh, I only have a few fans."
"Letâ€™s celebrate women, fight for equality and support each other,  not just today, but everyday!"
I love my new boyfriend.
I feel tired and don't want to write SQLs.
I had a pretty rough time during the last couple of weeks
