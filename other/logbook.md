##Week 2

###Parameters
- pb.solver: no effect at all (no PB clauses?)
- cardinality.solver: no effect at all (no card clauses?)
- unit_walk: much slower, can't enumerate programs with 3 lines

###Interesting instances
- 55-tests/54: susceptible to bind_rows
- 55-tests/12
- 55-tests/10
- 55-tests/14
- 55-tests/5

###Subject to non-determinism in original squares
- 55-tests/10

###Configuration attempts

####try6
    Config(seed=seed, disabled=['inner_join', 'semi_join'], filters_function_enabled=True, max_filter_combinations=1),
    Config(seed=seed, disabled=['inner_join', 'natural_join4'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),

    Config(seed=seed, disabled=['inner_join', 'semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    
##Week 3


###Reasons why instances fail
- Dates are not supported
- concat as an aggregation function (!= from concatenating two different columns, ie, unite)
- first as an aggregation function?? (only supported by some DBMS)
- needs INNER JOIN ON instead of NATURAL JOIN
- a column that is a max of 'something' must be called 'maxsomething' in the io example


###Trying to remove aggrs requirement
- Removed redundancy from filter conditions (eg: A==B and B==A, A<B and B\>A)
- Problem: SQUARES forced the generated filter conditions to appear on the program. Since we cannot do that anymore synthesis becomes much much much slower. Use multiple threads as a workaround?
  - eg: 55-tests/2 takes ages to go through 3 line programs, while forcing the constants makes it so that no 3 line programs are generated

###Interesting instances
- 55-tests/40

###Misc.
- Found out why running a configuration similar to original squares gave different results. The second Z3 solver (used for conflict analysis) was not being seeded.
  - However there is still some variation in the results...

###Configuration attempts
    
####try7 - first try without knowing aggrs
    Config(seed=seed, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=[], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=["max"], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=["min"], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=["mean"], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=["n"], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=["n", "max(n)"], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, aggregation_functions=["n", "max"], force_summarise=True, disabled=['semi_join'], z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    
## Week 4
###Reasons why instances fail
- Extracting parts of the date
- mutate (eg. SELECT sqrt(a-b) AS c) is needed sometimes (eg. cumulative sums)
- renaming columns (some very simple cases are already supported by using the new inner join)

###New things
- Inner join is finished
- Dates are now supported (kind of? too many formats...)
- concat as an aggregation function is now supported
- 'max(n)' is no longer a special case with lots of exceptions. Most R expressions can be used as filter conditions
- Removed redundant group by conditions (a, b) and (b, a)
- Removed redundant filter conditions (eg. n > 5 | n >= 5)   \[might be slightly slower for simple programs?\]

###Different solutions
- 55-tests/2
- 55-tests/4

###Configuration attempts
From this point onward the new filter, summarise and join condition code is used.

####try8 - knows args
    Config(seed=seed, ignore_aggrs=False, disabled=['inner_join', 'semi_join'], force_summarise=True, z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    Config(seed=seed, ignore_aggrs=False, disabled=['semi_join'], force_summarise=True, z3_QF_FD=True, z3_sat_phase='random'),
    
## Week 5

### Notes
- Starting one of the processes with higher loc helps solve most very hard instances. However, that makes it so that we no longer find the optimal solution to problems.

>We don't expose ways to print internal state. You could perhaps interrupt the solver, then clone it using the "translate" methods and access the translated solver state using internal print utilities. You would have to change the code a bit to get to this state.
 The print features on solvers don't access the internal state of any of the solvers, instead they look at the asserted formulas and print them.
 I don't translate learned lemmas. For example, the code in smt_context.cpp line 176 is disabled because it didn't help with any performance enhancements. Similarly, the copy code in sat_solver does not copy learned clauses even though it retains unit literals and binary clauses that are learned.

Open issue: https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/issues/2095

Nikolaj on StackOverflow:
>Yes, there are essentially two incremental modes.
>
>Stack based: using push(), pop() you create a local context, that follows a stack discipline. Assertions added under a push() are removed after a matching pop(). Furthermore, any lemmas that are derived under a push are removed. Use push()/pop() to emulate freezing a state and adding additional constraints over the frozen state, then resume to the frozen state. It has the advantage that any additional memory overhead (such as learned lemmas) built up within the scope of a push() is released. The working assumption is that learned lemmas under a push would not be useful any longer.
>
>Assumption based: using additional assumption literals passed to check()/check_sat() you can (1) extract unsatisfiable cores over the assumption literals, (2) gain local incrementality without garbage collecting lemmas that get derived independently of the assumptions. In other words, if Z3 learns a lemma that does not contain any of the assumption literals it expects to not garbage collect them. To use assumption literals effectively, you would have to add them to formulas too. So the tradeoff is that clauses used with assumptions contain some amount of bloat. For example if you want to locally assume some formula (<= x y), then you add a clause (=> p (<= x y)), and assume p when calling check_sat(). Note that the original assumption was a unit. Z3 propagates units efficiently. With the formulation that uses assumption literals it is no longer a unit at the base level of search. This incurs some extra overhead. Units become binary clauses, binary clauses become ternary clauses, etc.
>
>The differentiation between push/pop functionality holds for Z3's default SMT engine. This is the engine most formulas will be using. Z3 contains some portfolio of engines. For example, for pure bit-vector problems, Z3 may end up using the sat based engine. Incrementality in the sat based engine is implemented differently from the default engine. Here incrementality is implemented using assumption literals. Any assertion you add within the scope of a push is asserted as an implication (=> scope_literals formula). check_sat() within such a scope will have to deal with assumption literals. On the flip-side, any consequence (lemma) that does not depend on the current scope is not garbage collected on pop().

## Week of 12/7

### Sources of non-determinism
- (possible) overlooked usage of sets (vs orderedset)
- (possible) Z3 is not always deterministic, even when (doubly) seeded
- ~~By default all logical cores except two are used. In systems with SMT this might be more than the amount of physical cores available~~
- (possible) processes are dispatched using the order returned from the the python Poll object
- Scores are updated asynchronously
- Process-local cache for sub-programs (up to 2 lines by default)
- Process-local cache for transitive closure of condition generalizations
- Learned cubes (from UNSAT cores) are not synchronized
- ~~Consider using a new Random object for choosing the next line of a cube (based on n-grams) since seeding of the random module is only done at program start~~
